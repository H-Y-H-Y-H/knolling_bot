	abstract = {The rectangle packing area minimization problem ({RPAMP}) has a wide range of applications in industry. The purpose of {RPAMP} is to ensure maximum use of the materials used in industries and minimize the trim loss. The yield from materials is significant issue. Because a small change in placement can result in a significant reduction in production costs and material savings. In this study, 2D-{RPAMP}, which is widely seen in the manufacturing industry, has been investigated. The solution approaches have been developed by using heuristic methods such as no-fit polygon and bottom-left fill and metaheuristic method such as Simulated Annealing ({SA}). In experimental studies, the bottom-left fill method is used for the placement process, no-fit polygon method is used in order to avoid overlapping between the parts placed, and the {SA} algorithm is employed for the faster and efficient packing process. As a result of experiments using the hybrid methodology consisting of the {SA} algorithm can reach reasonable level of the trim loss varies that is between 0,21\% and 9,1\% for most industry. The experimental results show the efficiency of the packing process with hybrid methodology.},
