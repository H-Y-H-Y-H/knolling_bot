# Knolling Bot: Learning Robotic Object Arrangement from Tidy Demonstrations

This repository contains the supplementary materials for our paper titled "Knolling Bot: Learning Robotic Object Arrangement from Tidy Demonstrations," submitted for review. In this work, we address the complex challenge of organizing scattered items in domestic spaces by introducing a self-supervised learning framework. Inspired by advancements in natural language processing (NLP), our approach allows robots to understand and replicate the concept of tidiness from demonstrations of well-organized layouts.

## Usage
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file located in the root of the `knolling_bot` directory.

### Visualizing Prediction Results

Navigate to the Data_collection directory:

```
cd knolling_bot/Arrange_knolling_model/Data_collection
```
Run the visualization script:
```
python visualize_rst_in_pybullet.py
```

### Training the Model

Navigate to the train_and_test directory:
```
cd knolling_bot/Arrange_knolling_model/train_and_test
```
Execute the training script:
```
python model_train.py
```
### Testing the Model
After training, you can test the model by running:
```
python model_test.py
```

## Dataset Availability
The dataset used for training our model will be uploaded once the paper gets accepted.
