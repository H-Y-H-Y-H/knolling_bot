# Knolling Bot: Teaching Robots the Human Notion of Tidiness

This repository contains the code  for our paper titled "[Knolling Bot: Teaching Robots the Human Notion of Tidiness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04566)", by Yuhang Hu, Judah Goldfeder, Zhizhuo Zhang, Xinyue Zhu, Ruibo Liu, Philippe Wyder, Jiong Lin, and Hod Lipson, accepted at NeurIPS 2025. In this work, we address the complex challenge of organizing scattered items in domestic spaces by introducing a self-supervised learning framework. Inspired by advancements in natural language processing (NLP), our approach allows robots to understand and replicate the concept of tidiness from demonstrations of well-organized layouts.

## Repository Structure

- `knolling_bot/`: Directory housing the code for training and testing the knolling model.
  - `Arrange_knolling_model/`: Contains the implementation of our knolling model.
    - `train_and_test/`: Scripts and data for training and evaluating the model.
      - `data/flowing-moon-116/`: Directory where the trained model is stored.

## Usage
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file located in the root of the `knolling_bot` directory.

### Visualizing Prediction Results

Navigate to the Data_collection directory:

```
cd knolling_bot/Arrange_knolling_model/Data_collection
```
Run the visualization script:
```
python visualize_rst_in_pybullet.py
```

### Training the Model

Navigate to the train_and_test directory:
```
cd knolling_bot/Arrange_knolling_model/train_and_test
```
Execute the training script:
```
python model_train.py
```
### Testing the Model
After training, you can test the model by running:
```
python model_test.py
```

## Dataset Availability
The dataset used for training our model will be uploaded once the paper gets accepted.
